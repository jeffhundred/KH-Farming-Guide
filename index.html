						<div class="lucid-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Lucid Shard is dropped by Shadow Heartless. Shadows are some of the most common Heartless, and can be found almost anywhere. However, the highest concentration of Shadows are found in the Bizarre Room in wonderland; the section where the table and chair is.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The mass of Shadow Heartless in the Bizarre Room does not appear every time. They are only there when the Gigas Shadows are about to appear. The Shadows will spawn in three waves, getting larger each time. By using Thundaga here you can defeat dozens of Shadows in a minute or two.
							</p>

						<nav class="lucid-gem">LUCID GEM</nav>
						<div class="lucid-gem-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Lucid Gems are dropped by both the Wight Knight and Gargoyle Heartless. Both of these Heartless can be found all over Halloweentown, but the Graveyard in particular seems to be the best spot 
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								In the case where you are, in fact, doing your Lucid Gem farming in the Graveyard, it is worth mentioning that there is a slight chance for the White Mushroom to appear instead. If this is the case you can just leave and re-enter the Graveyard and they will most likely be gone.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="lucid-crystal">LUCID CRYSTAL</nav>
						<div class="lucid-crystal-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Lucid Crystal is an item dropped by the Darkball Heartless. Once you finish Hollow Bastion, these Heartless will spawn in almost every world, so you can usually pick up any Lucid Crystals you may need while hunting for other items. If you are looking to farm for specifically Lucid Crystals, then Moonlight Hill in Halloweentown will be the best place to find Darkball Heartless in mass.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								While the Darkball Heartless are very easy to defeat, they can do a significant amount of damage, and can also be quite deadly in large groups if you are under-leveled. It is best to keep your distance while farming these Heartless.
							</p>

						<nav class="spirit-shard">SPIRIT SHARD</nav>
						<div class="spirit-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Spirit Shard is dropped by Soldier Heartless, which can be best found in the Grand Hall in Hollow Bastion.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								I've noticed that the further along you get in the game, the less often you run into Soldier Heartless. So, it may be a good idea to farm as many as possible in the early stages of gameplay, when they appear more frequently.
							</p>

						<nav class="spirit-gem">SPIRIT GEM</nav>
						<div class="spirit-gem-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Spirit Gems are dropped by Air Soldier Heartless. These can also be found on the floor of the Bizarre Room in Wonderland.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Air Soldier will spawn in the Bizarre Room only when the Gigas Shadow is not going to appear. If you enter the Bizarre Room (where the table and chair is) and Shadow Heartless appear, then the Air Soldiers will not spawn, and you need to exit the Bizarre Room and enter again.

						<nav class="power-shard">POWER SHARD</nav>
						<div class="power-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Power Shards are dropped by Powerwild Heartless, which can be found near the tent in Deep Jungle.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								If you are early to mid game, then the Powerwild will spawn in pretty much all parts of Deep Jungle. It is only during the later stages where you need to focus on specifically the tent area.
							</p>
						</div>

						<nav class="power-gem">POWER GEM</nav>
						<div class="power-gem-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Power Gem is dropped by both the Pirate and Air Pirate Heartless. Both of these can be found on the ship in Neverland at all stages of gameplay.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								There isn't really a "best method" for farming these Heartless, although I've always preferred to use magic against rather than physical attacks.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="power-crystal">POWER CRYSTAL</nav>
						<div class="power-crystal-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Power Crystals are dropped by Wyvern Heartless. You can find these Heartless in Hollow Bastion, but if you are more towards the end of the game, the best place to farm them is at the Tree House in Deep Jungle.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								Wyverns don't always appear at the Tree House. Just take a few steps towards the tree house and if the Wyvern are going to spawn at all, they will right there.
							</p>
						</div>

					<section>
						<nav class="blaze-shard">BLAZE SHARD</nav>
						<div class="blaze-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								You can farm the Red Nocturne Heartless for Blaze Shards. These are most easily found in the chambers of Monstro.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								As long as you don't cast fire, you can defeat the Red Nocturne any other way. However, I would recommend using physical attacks, as you can destroy these Heartless usually with a single combo.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="blaze-gem">BLAZE GEM</nav>
						<div class="blaze-gem-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Blaze Gems are dropped by both the Bandit and Fat Bandit, which can be found in the Bowels area of Monstro. Another good location would be the Cave of Wonders in Agrabah.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								While I normally recommend using physical attacks against all elemental Heartless, the Blizzaga spell can really go a long way against the Fat Bandit's fire attacks.
							</p>

					<section>
						<nav class="frost-shard">FROST SHARD</nav>
						<div class="frost-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Frost Shards can be farmed from the Blue Rhapsody Heartless, and are best found in the Lotus Forest in Wonderland.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								Like all other elemental Heartless, you could use the Firaga spell to counter the Blue Rhapsody's blizzard attacks, but I would still recommend using Keyblade combos.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="frost-gem">FROST GEM</nav>
						<div class="frost-gem-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Frost Gems are dropped by the Sea Neon Hearless, which can be found all over Atlantica
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								Thundaga is your best friend when farming Sea Neons. With your mobility being limited due to being in Atlantica, Thundaga is a simple way to farm for Frost Gems, without having to move much. 
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="thunder-shard">THUNDER SHARD</nav>
						<div class="thunder-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								You can farm Thunder Shards from the Yellow Opera Heartless which can be found in the Lotus Forest in Wonderland.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								These are the same as both the Blue Rhapsody and Red Nocturne Heartless. Just keep comboing away and you should be able to pick up the Thunder Shards you need in no time.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="thunder-gem">THUNDER GEM</nav>
						<div class="thunder-gem-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Thunder Gem is dropped by the Screwdiver and Aquatank Heartless, which can be found all throughout Atlantica.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Screwdivers absorb all of your thunder spells, so it is best to use firaga in this case. Because Firaga is not as efficient as Thundaga, farming for Thunder Gems can be a long process.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="shiny-crystal">SHINY CRYSTAL</nav>
						<div class="shiny-crystal-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Shiny Crystals are dropped by the Wizard Heartless, which can be found in either Hollow Bastion or in the hotel in Traverse Town. If you are also looking to farm for Bright Crystals, then I would recommend the latter.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								Wizards are one of the hardest Heartless to farm. They will absorb all magic (excluding Gravaga) and have brief periods of invincibility. On top of all that, Shiny Crystals have a very low drop rate, so be patient. 
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="bright-shard">BRIGHT SHARD</nav>
						<div class="bright-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Bright Shards are dropped by the Green Requiem Heartless, which spawn, in mass, at the Cliff in Deep Jungle. More specifically, at the very top of the cliff on the right hand side
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								Green Requiems are rather easy to farm, as they do not attack. They do, however absorb most magic and can heal surrounding Heartless.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="bright-gem">BRIGHT GEM</nav>
						<div class="bright-gem-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Search Ghost drops Bright Gems. These can best be found in the Green Room at the Hotel in Traverse Town.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								These are another Heartless that appear less frequently the further in the game you get. If you get a chance, it may be wise to farm these when they first spawn in Halloweentown.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="bright-crystal">BRIGHT CRYSTAL</nav>
						<div class="bright-crystal-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Bright Crystal is dropped by Defender Heartless. For the most Defenders, the best place to farm is in the Third District of Traverse Town. However, if you are also farming Wizard Heartless, you can find Defenders in the Hotel lobby as well.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								Like most larger Heartless, leveling up your MP and spamming Thundaga is the best way to farm Defenders quickly. You will kill the Defenders as fast as possible, because getting them to drop the Bright Crystal is almost impossible. Be patient and keep at them, it will drop eventually. 
							</p>

					<section>
						<nav class="mystery-goo">MYSTERY GOO</nav>
						<div class="mystery-goo-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Mystery Goo is Dropped by the White Mushroom Heartless. They appear in one specific area for each world except Hollow Bastion and Olympus Coliseum. Here are the locations:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Traverse Town: Red Room</li>
								<li>Wonderland: Lotus Forest</li>
								<li>Deep Jungle: Camp Site</li>
								<li>Agrabah: Treasure Room</li>
								<li>Halloweentown: Graveyard</li>
								<li>Atlantica: Undersea Cave and Sunken Ship</li>
								<li>End of the World: Linked Worlds</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								You farm the White Mushroom by casting magic on it. Cast the indicated spell after the White Mushroom gives you the following prompts:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Mushroom is shivering: Fire</li>
								<li>Mushroom fans itself: Blizzard</li>
								<li>A light appears over the Mushroom: Thunder</li>
								<li>Mushroom falls to the ground: Cure</li>
								<li>Mushroom hovers in the air: Gravity</li>
								<li>Mushroom completely freezes: Stop</li>
								<li>Mushroom spins rapidly: Aero</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								You need to cast the same kind of magic three times for the Mystery Goo to drop (about 10% of the time) but if you cast the wrong spell, the White Mushroom will disappear.
							</p>

						<nav class="gale">GALE</nav>
						<div class="gale-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Both the Invisible and Angel Star Heartless drop Gale. Both of these Heartless can be found at the End of the World in Linked Worlds (the area directly before Final Rest).
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Angel Star and Invisible are some of the most intense Heartless in the entire game. While I would recommend using physical attacks for both of these Heartless, it is absolutely necessary for the Angel Star as it absorbs all magic you may cast towards it.
							</p>

					<section>
						<nav class="mythril-shard">MYTHRIL SHARD</nav>
						<div class="mythril-shard-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Mythril Shard is dropped by the Pot Spider Which can be found all over Agrabah as well as inside the chambers of Monstro.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								There really isn't much to these Heartless. Spamming Thundaga is a good way to farm most Heartless, but physical attacks will also get the job done here.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="mythril">MYTHRIL</nav>
						<div class="mythril-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Mythril is synthesized at the Moogle Shop (see recipes for a list of the items needed).
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								You can also find Mythrils in several treasure chests throughout the game, so be sure to search high and low.

						<nav class="orichalcum">ORICHALCUM</nav>
						<div class="orichalcum-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								While there are a couple other ways, such as Trinities, to obtain Orichalcum, they can also simply be bought from the Item Shop for 1000 Munny.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								If you are farming for specifically Munny, a good place is the Third District of Traverse Town, where several waves of Defenders and Darkballs appear.

						<nav class="fury-stone">FURY STONE</nav>
						<div class="fury-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Fury Stone is dropped by the Gigas Shadow in the Bizarre Room in Wonderland; the area with the table and chair.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Gigas Shadow will only spawn after three waves of regular Shadow Heartless. The key to getting Fury Stones to drop is to not let the Gigas Shadows touch Sora. The best way to do this is to get all the Gigas into one area by running around the room, casting Stopga and then combo them with the keyblade. A less efficient way to farm the Gigas Shadows is to jump onto the table quickly and spam Thundaga.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="power-stone">POWER STONE</nav>
						<div class="power-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Power Stones are dropped by they Sniperwild which only appear in the Second District of Traverse Town. If Three Wyverns spawn as soon as you enter the Second District, the Sniperwild will not appear.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Sniperwild appear in three waves and the key is to not be seen. The first wave has only one Sniperwild, so you can just jump behind it and combo it, but make sure to hide before the next wave comes. The final two waves of Sniperwild (one of two and one of three) are more tricky. It is best to wait on the walkway by the Hotel for one of the Sniperwild to jump up and then attack it. Once you defeat all three waves a Power Stone will drop and the cycle will repeat.
							</p>

					<section>
						<nav class="energy-stone">ENERGY STONE</nav>
						<div class="energy-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Energy Stone is dropped by the Stealth Soldier which appears in both the Entrance Hall and Grand Hall in Hollow Bastion.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Stealth Soldier is an almost completely invisible, fast moving enemy, and while you can lock onto it, the only way to defeat this Heartless is to use Stop magic. You almost need to have Stopga for this farm as even Stopra may not give you enough time to catch up to it. Cast Stopga, perform one single combo, and repeat until defeated.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<nav class="blazing-stone">BLAZING STONE</nav>
						<div class="blazing-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Blazing Stones are dropped by the Chimera which appears at the Manor Ruins in Halloweentown. The Chimera doesn't always appear, but there is actually a glitch in the game that lets us know if he is going to spawn. There is a Red Trinity on the stone gate at Manor Ruins that will still appear after you activate it, but only if the Chimera is NOT going to spawn. If the Trinity is gone, like it should be, then the Chimera will appear after a few rounds of Wight Knights.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								This farm can either be easy or easy but long. Basically you just keep comboing him until he starts shooting different colored balls towards you. You need to deflect these back at the Chimera for the Blazing Stone to drop. If you found all 100 dalmations and recieved Aeroga, then you can use this to automatically deflect the balls back. If you only have Aerora, then the same principle applies, it just may take longer.

						<nav class="frost-stone">FROST STONE</nav>
						<div class="frost-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Frost Stone is dropped by the Grand Ghost which appears in the Stomach of Monstro.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Grand Ghost is an enemy whose HP will only drop by feeding items to it. This encounter's difficulty all depends on how cheap you want to be. The more expensive the item you feed to it, the more damage it does. For example, if you want to splurge on this battle, a Megalixir will one-shot the Grand Ghost.

					<section>
						<nav class="lightning-stone">LIGHTNING STONE</nav>
						<div class="lightning-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Lightning Stones are dropped by the Black Ballade located in the Bamboo Thicket in Deep Jungle.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								The Black Ballade appear in a group of five, and it is like one of those games where you have to follow a single one as they dance around. Choose the correct one three times and the Lightning stone will drop. If you are bad at these kinds of games, you can "cheat" by rapidly pausing and un-pausing the game as the Black Ballade dance around.
							</p>

					<section>
						<nav class="dazzling-stone">DAZZLING STONE</nav>
						<div class="dazzling-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								The Dazzling Stone is dropped by the Jet Balloon Heartless which only appear on the deck of the ship in Neverland.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								Farming the Jet Balloon is similar to the method for the Stealth Soldier. Cast Stopga and then combo away until it wears off.
							</p>

					<section>
						<nav class="stormy-stone">STORMY STONE</nav>
						<div class="stormy-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Stormy Stones are dropped by the Neoshadow Heartless which appear in Linked Worlds at The End of the World. It is extremely difficult to get the Neoshadow to appear. You may need to leave on the Gummi Ship and re-enter.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								This one is a tough farm; if you are having trouble, it may be best to equip accessories that reduce dark damage. Neoshadows appear in groups of eight and you need to defeat them all to get the Stormy Stone to drop. Once you get down to the last Neoshadow it will go to the center of the room and multiply into eight, non-moving replicas of itself. You will have a very short amount of time to hit each replica once, or else it will grow into an entire Neoshadow.
							</p>

					<section>
						<nav class="mythril-stone">MYTHRIL STONE</nav>
						<div class="mythril-stone-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Mythril Stones are dropped by the Pot Scorpion that appears at the Palace Gates in Agrabah.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								If the Pot Scorpion is going to appear, then the Palace Gates will contain a 4X4 square of seemingly normal pots. Inside one of these pots is the pot Scorpion. To get it to come out, you must first smash all the pots that do not contain the Pot Scorpion. If you walk into a pot and it moves, that means the pot is empty. Once the Pot Scorpion comes out, you will need to stun it before you can do any damage. You can stun the Pot Scorpion by guarding when it runs at you, or if you have Aeroga, it will deflect automatically.

					<section>
						<nav class="dark-matter">DARK MATTER</nav>
						<div class="dark-matter-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								This is another item that is obtained through item synthesis at the Moogle Shop.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								There is also a treasure chest or two that contain Dark Matter. However, they are extremely difficult to find. For example in the Waterway in Hollow Bastion, you can cast Blizzaga on the teleport bubbles which allows you to stand on top of them briefly. From here you can jump on top of the walls where there is a chest with Dark Matter inside of it.

						<nav class="serenity-power">SERENITY POWER</nav>
						<div class="serenity-power-description">
							<h3>HOW TO OBTAIN</h3>
							<p>
								Serenity Power is dropped by the Pink Agaricus. This Heartless appears in both the Tree House in Deep Jungle and in Atlantica. However it is pretty much impossible to farm the one in Atlantica, so we'll focus on the one in Deep Jungle.
							</p>
							<h3>TIPS</h3>
							<p>
								You 100% need both Stopga and Aeroga for this farm, so better start finding those puppies now. If the Pink Agaricus is going to appear, it will be preceded by three, completely still, White Mushroom Heartless that can be located anywhere in or around the tree house. You will need to find all three and cast Stopga on each one. Once this is done the Pink Agaricus will appear inside of the tree house. From here, you need to cast Stopga on the Pink Agaricus and try to score as many hits on it as possible. The best way to get the highest number of hits is to first cast Aeroga and then alternate between a regular combo and a Ragnarok limit. Make sure you are locked onto the head and not the body or else your timing may get messed up. Once stopga wears off it will start counting your hits and drop an item for every ten hits. Only around 50 or 60 hits will you have a chance of recieving a Serenity Power, which is why you need the full level ups of Stopga and Aeroga.
